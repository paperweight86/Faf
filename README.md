# Faf
Single file libraries for loading file formats.

## SVG
There's a basic SVG loader in svg.h which requires rapidxml (http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net/) at the moment and is very basic and incomplete. It only implements loading of paths within a single group into a list of operations. Will probably transform into something more streamlined later.
